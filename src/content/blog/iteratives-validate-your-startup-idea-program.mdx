I got it. Out of 700+ applicants, I am one of the 25 applicants who made it into Iterative's [Validate Your Startup Idea Program](https://www.iterative.vc/validate-your-startup-idea). For those that don't know about [Iterative](https://www.iterative.vc/), it's a Y-Combinators styled Venture Capital in SEA.

I remember telling Stephanie right after the final round of interview that I'm definitely not landing it. My gut shot feeling was that I bombed it hard. I was so unprepared, and probably fluff-ed my way through. I moved on pretty quick after that though.

But now that I'm in, I'm definitely going to extract the most value out of this program. Iterative is pretty transparent and publicize a lot of their teaching, so the core content of the program that I'm going through can be found [here](https://academy.iterative.vc/spaces/16499724/content).

What made it extra valuable for me is the direct access to program mentors, and the Iterative founder – Hsu Ken Ooi who is really knowledgeable about building companies.

I'll just ended the week 1 of the program, and I'll share more in a subsequent thought as I consoldiate all my learnings.
