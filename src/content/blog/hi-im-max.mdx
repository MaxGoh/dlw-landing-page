Hilariously enough, I wanted to start by introducing myself professionally. Thinking deeper here, who actually am I?

Taking a breather.. Alright, here goes.

Hi! I'm Max, a Singaporean living in his sunny home country. I have two beautiful cat (Butters & Blue) who has been part of my life for the past four years. I enjoy working out, and I have been going to REVL fitness classes for a few months now. I used to play a bit of Table Tennis & Pickleball, but after I torn my cuboid (ankle) ligament a month ago, I decided to stop sports (specifically Pickleball) entirely. I felt like it just wasn't worth injuring myself again. I'm going for health & longevity, not a Pickleball championship.

Looking back, my goal in life has changed considerably. From a scientist, to a doctor, to just moving to the states, to hitting career ladder milestones, and now trying to become an entrepreneur. "You win some, and you lose some". I didn't become a doctor, but I did become a computer scientist (software engineer ðŸ˜Ž). I didn't moved to the states, but I did move to Dublin, Ireland and worked in AWS for 2.5 years, and I did hit the career ladder milestone that I wanted, which to become a Staff Software Engineer at a BigTech company. I'm still working on the last one, which I believe, and hope would be for the next decade of my life.

I've been journalling down in my personal digital vault for sometime now. I decided to write online again to build this online presence about myself, and I envision myself in a decade of so to look back my posts, and using LLM (Large language models) to talk to me today. ðŸ¤£

If you are still here, I'd plan to write more about my life, my personal and corporate learnings, and how I'll grow into an entrepreneur.
